The Dock Mod theme

This theme is a proof of concept theme that I created while working on the dock
within Moodle 2.0.

It simply modifies the dock from within the theme allowing it to be moved to from
the left hand side of the screen to the top, then to the right, and finally back
to the left.
It does this in the least invasive way possible by simply extending the dock's
JavaScript by using event listeners and by adding a marginal amount of CSS.
There are also instructions within the JS file as to how to fix the dock to once
position (top, or right) which can be done very easily. The advantage of this is
that you can position the dock where you wish and usually do it with only 3 lines
of JavaScript and a dozen lines of CSS.

You should also note that this theme will not work with IE 6 or IE7 as it 
presently uses display:inline-block to align the items on the dock when it is 
horizontal. However it would not be a big task to get it working using floats.
I simply havn't done it because I havn't had time.

Anyway if you have any questions feel free to ask them in the Moodle theme's
forum as there are lots of people there who will be able to help you.
